- when u have a rw cd it doesn't ask if u want to clean it first (done but should be moved to ncb instead)
- gtk_util.HigProgress should be visible in taskbar, not have a parent and be
  minizable
- handle adding operations in a queue when it's already running
- emit to context when dnd has moved successfully
- add export to playlist and export to CUE/WAVs
