- Make list items moveable (they do not hcange positions): TreeView DND is apparently bugged (at least 2.4.0)
- Make recording cancelable (currently lib-n-b ignores it)
- check for temp size and verify perms
- when u have a rw cd it doesn't ask if u want to clean it first
- serpentine_shell.py needs looove!
- we need to handle the recording process better:
  * lock the drive before converting
  * check if user has a cdrw inserted
  * check if user has a blank cd or a cdrw
- gtk_util.HigProgress should be visible in taskbar and not have a parent and 
  minizable
- add gconf entries
- handle adding operations in a queue when it's already running
