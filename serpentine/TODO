- when u have a rw cd it doesn't ask if u want to clean it first (done but 
  should be moved to ncb instead)
- Make it possible to close serpentine main window without stopping a recording
  operation (dbus.SessionBus).
- emit to context when dnd has moved successfully, highlight TreeView
- add export to playlist and export to CUE/WAVs
- When a list of files is added order the files which have the same album name 
  and track number
- recent files support (?)
